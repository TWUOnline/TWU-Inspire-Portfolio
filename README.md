## About

One of a series of WordPress child themes developed for Trinity Western University. To work as a portfolio, this requires (and will nag on a new site if not present) the [TWU Portfolio Helper plugin](https://github.com/TWUOnline/TWU-Portfolio-Helper) which creates a custom post type for portfolio artifacts as well as a custom taxonomies for organizing them. The plugin also provides shortcodes for flexible display of portfolio information anywhere in a site.

This theme is designed to be used as a template that is cloned for a new site, but it does provide internally the information on how to set up the front page (which us a custom template to displat the most recent artifacts).

The theme also adds a special admin menu with links to portfolio guides as well as a section on how to customize the theme http://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/portfolio-themes/twu-inspire/
